--------------------- EKF_rocket.m -----------------------
* Adapt noise values

* Create a "update_step" function for current sensors (should be made after mag)
    => might require "measurement_model" (z) & "measurement_jacobian" (H) functions

* Check all FIXMEs

--------------------- run_simulation.m -----------------------

1st section
    * change custom plots controls
    * change sensors to use

2nd section (load data)
    * change data

3rd section (EKF parameters)
    * change parameters

4th section (init state)
    * change "Nav" value ?

5th section (Plotting stuff)
    * adapt wirh respect to 1st section

6th section (Simulation loop)
    * remove gps_traj
    * directely use traj data (no "passing through gps/imu" models)
    * check and possibly remove "ifs"
    * check and possibly remvoe "Error plots related" part

7th section (Attitude conversion to euler angles)
    * probably useless <=> remove if able

8th section (Plots)
    * Adapt to data and other sections
        => Keep what is relevent and add what's missing
